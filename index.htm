<p>Every cookie made at the Jose Cookie company is crafted with only the best ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the tastyest flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs from chickens that are free range. Even our water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve. Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
